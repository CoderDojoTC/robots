Programming Robots
===========================

This documentation supports the `CoderDojo Twin Cities'`_ Robots code group.
We primarily use Finch robots, but we also have a couple of mBots available.
We focus on using the block programming language, Scratch, to program both
types of robots, but it is possible to program them using other languages,
such as Python for the Finch robots.

See the `Finch robot webpage`_ for general information about the Finch robot.

See the `Makeblock webpage`_ for general information about the mBot.
