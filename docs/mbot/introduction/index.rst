Introduction to the mBot robot
##############################

This page gives an introduction to the mBot and describes how to set it up
in the CoderDojoTC environment.

There are two Macbooks labeled for the mBot robot. These already have the program
mBlock (a version scratch for mBot) installed. If you need to install mBlock on
another computer, you can download it from the `mBlock downloads page`_.

=============================
Getting started with the mBot
=============================

Follow these steps to get started with the mBot:

#. Turn on the mBot using the switch on the side.  There will be a blue light
   that blinks on the wireless card inside the mBot.
#. Plug in the wireless USB dongle to the computer.  The previously mentioned blue 
   light will stop blinking and become solid blue.  This indicates that the connection
   has been made between the mBot and the dongle.
#. Open the mBlock program on the computer.
#. Connect to the mBot from within mBlock to send code.  In the toolbar at the top of
   the screen, click *connect* and then click on the *2.4G* option from the drop-down
   menu.
